This is GStreamer FFmpeg 0.8.2

Changes since 0.8.1:
	Demuxers:
	* ffmpeg demuxer wrapper timestamp fixes. Tested are RoQ and Interplay,
	  several other gaming formats might actually work, too.
	* signals no_more_pads now, handles events.
	* use the "new" av_read_frame() instead of av_read_packet().

	Colorspace:
	* palette handling in the colorspace converter.

	Decoders:
	* real video codec negotiation fixes. Works on the commandline, doesn't
	  work in playbin just yet.
	* lots of codec extradata handling fixes (e.g. MS MPEG, WMV), also
	  several codec palette handling fixes.
	* increase priority for ffdec_msmpeg4 so it overtakes divxdec.
	* proper timestamp handling if a input buffer contains multiple
	  audio/video frames.

	Muxers:
	* memleak fix.

Bugs fixed since 0.8.1:
	* 150449 : ffdemux_mpegts causes internal error: push on pad
	* 152798 : wmv2/wma2 file fails to play back

This is GStreamer FFmpeg 0.8.0
