	* gstreamer-sharp/DynamicSignalHandlerGenerator.cs: This class is 
	reponsible for generating a custom delegate class which supports 
	variable number of parameters.

	* gstreamer-sharp/DyanmicSignalMarshalHandler.cs: This is an abstract
	class and is derived by the new type generated by the Generator.
	This class makes it easy for me to work with the new type.

	* gstreamer-sharp/Element.custom: Added functions to add a custom signal,
	a function which marshall's the signal parameters.

	* sample/HelloWorld.cs: Added a sample to show the usuage of a custom signal.

	* gstreamer-sharp/glue/Bin.c: added this file to the source. It has only one 
	function which gives offset of *children in the C struct.

	* gstreamer-sharp/glue/Makefile.am: added Bin.c to the list of C source that
	must be compiled.

	* tests/ElementTest.cs: added NUnit tests for Element class.

	* tests/Makefile.am: added ElementTest.cs to the list of TestSuite

	* tests/BinTest.cs: fixed the test for Bin.Children

	* doc/gst-sharp-docs.zip:
	* doc/gst-sharp-docs.tree: Removing, this is a left over from
	something old (new prefix seems to be: gstreamer-sharp-). 

	* doc/en/Gst/Clock.xml: Fixing the docs to represent the change
	introduced in the last commit.

	* sample/DecodeBinTranscoder.cs: Fixing ambigious cast.

	* gstreamer-sharp/glue/clock.c:
	* gstreamer-sharp/Clock.custom: Changing the gint64 to guint64 and
	long to ulong respectively. The clocktime (GstClockTime) is measured
	in nanoseconds as unsigned long inside GStreamer. 
	This is introducing a small schizophrenia since some functions (such
	as queries, seeks) take signed long (-1 to mark infinity or error).
	This is the expected Gst behaviour.
	Just sticking silently to long (instead of ulong) will bork us 	sooner
	or later, especially for custom-build low level routines/elements.
	Comments welcome.

	* tests/PadTest.cs:
	* tests/Makefile.am: Introducing a new test for Gst.Pad. All fixtures pass.

	* tests/CapsTest.cs: Adding a new fixture for caps union testing (passes).
	Fixing some code-style errors.

	* README: Fixing a broken svn link to gtk-sharp sources.

	* tests/CapsTest.cs:
	* tests/Makefile.am: Introducing a new test for Gst.Caps. All fixtures pass.

	* gstreamer-sharp/Gstreamer.metadata: Hide the Children property and
	implement own version in Bin.custom to return an Element [] instead of
	a GLib.List

	* gstreamer-sharp/Bin.custom: Implement Bin.Children

	* tests/BinTest.cs: wrote a test for Bin.Children

2006-05-21  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* gstreamer-sharp/plugins-base/DecodeBin.cs: Added a quick binding for
	decodebin to test new-decoded-pad; probably is only a temporary solution

	* sample/DecodeBinTranscoder.cs: Added a small decodebin sample
	
	* sample/Makefile.am: Added build rules for decodebin sample

	* gstreamer-sharp.mdp: Updated MonoDevelop project
