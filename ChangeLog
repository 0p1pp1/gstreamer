	* sample/DecodeBinTranscoder.cs: Fixing ambigious cast.

	* gstreamer-sharp/glue/clock.c:
	* gstreamer-sharp/Clock.custom: Changing the gint64 to guint64 and
	long to ulong respectively. The clocktime (GstClockTime) is measured
	in nanoseconds as unsigned long inside GStreamer. 
	This is introducing a small schizophrenia since some functions (such
	as queries, seeks) take signed long (-1 to mark infinity or error).
	This is the expected Gst behaviour.
	Just sticking silently to long (instead of ulong) will bork us 	sooner
	or later, especially for custom-build low level routines/elements.
	Comments welcome.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Introducing a new test for Gst.Pad. All fixtures pass.
