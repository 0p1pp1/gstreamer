/**
 * SECTION: ges-timeline-transition
 * @short_description: Transition from one clip to another in a
 * #GESTimelineLayer
 *
 * Creates an object that mixes together the two underlying objects, A and B.
 * The A object is assumed to have a higher prioirity (lower number) than the
 * B object. At the transition in point, only A will be visible, and by the
 * end only B will be visible. 
 * 
 * The shape of the video transition depends on the value of the "vtype"
 * property. The default value is "crossfade". For audio, only "crossfade" is
 * supported.
 *
 * #GESSimpleTimelineLayer will automatically manage the priorities of sources
 * and transitions. If you use #GESTimelineTransitions in another type of
 * #GESTimelineLayer, you will need to manage priorities yourself.
