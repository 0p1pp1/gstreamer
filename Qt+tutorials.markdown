# Welcome to the GStreamer SDK Qt tutorials

These tutorials describe Qt-specific topics. General GStreamer concepts
will not be explained in these tutorials, so the [Basic
tutorials](http://docs.gstreamer.com/display/GstSDK/Basic+tutorials) should
be reviewed first. The reader should also be familiar with basic Qt
programming techniques.

The Qt tutorials have the same structure as the [Android
tutorials](Android%2Btutorials.html): Each one builds on top of the
previous one and adds progressively more functionality, until a working
media player application is obtained in \#FIXME\#
