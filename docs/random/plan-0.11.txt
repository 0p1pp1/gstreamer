Plan for 0.11
=============

First attempt at making a list of tasks in rougly chronological order.


* General cleanup

  - Remove deprecated methods
  - Cleanup structs + PADDING
  - ..

* Add GstFlowReturn for events (and query)

* add return structure for events and query

* Make GstMiniObject a simple boxed type

  - Move copy and free function to structure
  - convert GstBuffer, GstEvent, GstMessage, GstQuery,
    
* Convert GstCaps to GstMiniObject

* Incremental caps

  - Remove array from caps ?
  - make caps iterator

* Make GstBufferMetadata

  - Make functions to register metadata
  - Make common metadata: timeinfo, memory data, video data
  - Remove GstBuffer Fields
  - Make methods to add metadata to buffers.

* Negotiation of metadata

  - figure out if we need to negotiate the metadata on the caps or if we can
    gracefully degrade when an element doesn't understand the metadata.

* Rework reverse negotiation

  - _alloc_buffer() never returns changed caps. It can return a return
     value when the caller should recheck the allowed caps.

  - _alloc_buffer() takes input GstBuffer prototype (or NULL)

  - upstream event to notify of a downstream caps change

* Incremental event progation

  - certain events would be sticky on a pad like for caps
  - rules for pushing an event downstream
     - right before pushing a buffer
     - after link operation
  - activate for most serialized downstream events

* GstSegment changes

  - remove segment accumulation
  - add accumulated time to the event
  - apply segment info to pads
  - add method on pads to get/adjust sync offset
  - add method on pads to query current running_time
