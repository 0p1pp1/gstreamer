  <title>Pipeline manipulation</title>
  <para>
    This chapter will discuss how you can manipulate your pipeline in several
    ways from your application on. Parts of this chapter are downright
    hackish, so be assured that you'll need some programming knowledge
    before you start reading this.
  </para>
  <para>
    Topics that will be discussed here include how you can insert data into
    a pipeline from your application, how to read data from a pipeline,
    how to manipulate the pipeline's speed, length, starting point and how
    to listen to a pipeline's data processing.

    <title>Data probing</title>
    <para>
      Probing is best envisioned as a pad listener. Technically, a probe is
      nothing more than a callback that can be attached to a pad.
      You can attach a probe using <function>gst_pad_add_probe ()</function>.
      Similarly, one can use the
      <function>gst_pad_remove_probe ()</function>
      to remove the callback again.
    </para>
    <para>
      Probes run in pipeline threading context, so callbacks should try to
      not block and generally not do any weird stuff, since this could
      have a negative impact on pipeline performance or, in case of bugs,
      cause deadlocks or crashes. More precisely, one should usually not
      call any GUI-related functions from within a probe callback, nor try
      to change the state of the pipeline.  An application may post custom
      messages on the pipeline's bus though to communicate with the main
      application thread and have it do things like stop the pipeline.
    </para>
    <para>
      In any case, most common buffer operations
      that elements can do in <function>_chain ()</function> functions, can
      be done in probe callbacks as well. The example below gives a short
      impression on how to use them (even if this usage is not entirely
      correct, but more on that below):

    <para>
      Strictly speaking, a pad probe callback is only allowed to modify the
      buffer content if the buffer is writable.  Whether this is the case or
      not depends a lot on the pipeline and the elements involved.  Often
      enough, this is the case, but sometimes it is not, and if it is not
      then unexpected modification of the data or metadata can introduce
      bugs that are very hard to debug and track down. You can check if a
      buffer is writable with <function>gst_buffer_is_writable ()</function>.
      Since you can pass back a different buffer than the one passed in,
      it is a good idea to make the buffer writable in the callback function
      with <function>gst_buffer_make_writable ()</function>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Pad probes are suited best for looking at data as it passes through
      the pipeline. If you need to modify data, you should better write your
      own GStreamer element. Base classes like GstAudioFilter, GstVideoFilter or
      GstBaseTransform make this fairly easy.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you just want to inspect buffers as they pass through the pipeline,
      you don't even need to set up pad probes. You could also just insert
      an identity element into the pipeline and connect to its "handoff"
      signal. The identity element also provides a few useful debugging tools
      like the "dump" property or the "last-message" property (the latter is
      enabled by passing the '-v' switch to gst-launch and by setting the
      silent property on the identity to FALSE).

    <title>Manually adding or removing data from/to a pipeline</title>
    <para>
      Many people have expressed the wish to use their own sources to inject
      data into a pipeline. Some people have also expressed the wish to grab
      the output in a pipeline and take care of the actual output inside
      their application. While either of these methods are strongly
      discouraged, &GStreamer; offers support for this.
      <emphasis>Beware! You need to know what you are doing.</emphasis> Since
      you don't have any support from a base class you need to thoroughly
      understand state changes and synchronization. If it doesn't work,
      there are a million ways to shoot yourself in the foot.  It's always
      better to simply write a plugin and have the base class manage it.
      See the Plugin Writer's Guide for more information on this topic. Also
      see the next section, which will explain how to embed plugins statically
      in your application.
    </para>
    <para>
      There's two possible elements that you can use for the above-mentioned
      purposes. Those are called <quote>appsrc</quote> (an imaginary source)
      and <quote>appsink</quote> (an imaginary sink). The same method applies
      to each of those elements. Here, we will discuss how to use those
      elements to insert (using appsrc) or grab (using appsink) data from a
      pipeline, and how to set negotiation.
    </para>
    <para>
      Both appsrc and appsink provide 2 sets of API. One API uses standard
      GObject (action) signals and properties. The same API is also
      available as a regular C api. The C api is more performant but
      requires you to link to the app library in order to use the elements.

      <title>Inserting data with appsrc</title>
      <para>
        First we look at some examples for appsrc, which lets you insert data
        into the pipeline from the application. Appsrc has some configuration
        options that define how it will operate. You should decide about the
        following configurations:

          <para>
            Will the appsrc operate in push or pull mode. The stream-type
            property can be used to control this. stream-type of
            <quote>random-access</quote> will activate pull mode scheduling
            while the other stream-types activate push mode.

            The caps of the buffers that appsrc will push out. This needs to
            be configured with the caps property. The caps must be set to a
            fixed caps and will be used to negotiate a format downstream.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            It the appsrc operates in live mode or not. This can be configured
            with the is-live property. When operating in live-mode it is
            important to configure the min-latency and max-latency in appsrc.
            The min-latency should be set to the amount of time it takes between
            capturing a buffer and when it is pushed inside appsrc.
            In live mode, you should timestamp the buffers with the pipeline
            running-time when the first byte of the buffer was captured before
            feeding them to appsrc. You can let appsrc do the timestaping with
            the do-timestamp property (but then the min-latency must be set
            to 0 because it timestamps based on the running-time when the buffer
            entered appsrc).

            has implications for how the running-time of the buffers will
            be calculated so you must be sure you understand this. For
            live sources you probably want to set the format property to
            GST_FORMAT_TIME. For non-live source it depends on the media type
            that you are handling. If you plan to timestamp the buffers, you
            should probably put a GST_FORMAT_TIME format, otherwise
            GST_FORMAT_BYTES might be appropriate.

        <listitem>
          <para>
            If appsrc operates in random-access mode, it is important to configure
            the size property of appsrc with the number of bytes in the stream.
            This will allow downstream elements to know the size of the media and
            alows them to seek to the end of the stream when needed.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        The main way of handling data to appsrc is by using the function
        <function>gst_app_src_push_buffer ()</function> or by emiting the
        push-buffer action signal.  This will put the buffer onto a queue from
        which appsrc will read from in its streaming thread. It is important
        to note that data transport will not happen from the thread that
        performed the push-buffer call.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <quote>max-bytes</quote> property controls how much data can be
        queued in appsrc before appsrc considers the queue full. A filled
        internal queue will always signal the <quote>enough-data</quote>
        signal, which signals the application that it should stop pushing
        data into appsrc. The <quote>block</quote> property will cause appsrc to
        block the push-buffer method until free data becomes available again.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the internal queue is running out of data, the
        <quote>need-data</quote> signal is emitted, which signals the application
        that it should start pushing more data into appsrc.
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition to the <quote>need-data</quote> and <quote>enough-data</quote>
        signals, appsrc can emit the <quote>seek-data</quote> signal when the
        <quote>stream-mode</quote> property is set to <quote>seekable</quote>
        or <quote>random-access</quote>. The signal argument will contain the
        new desired position in the stream expressed in the unit set with the
        <quote>format</quote> property. After receiving the seek-data signal,
        the application should push-buffers from the new position.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the last byte is pushed into appsrc, you must call
        <function>gst_app_src_end_of_stream ()</function> to make it send
        an EOS downstream.
      </para>
      <para>
        These signals allow the application to operate appsrc in push and
        pull mode as will be explained next.

        <title>Using appsrc in push mode</title>
        <para>
          When appsrc is configured in push mode (stream-type is stream or
          seekable), the application repeatedly calls the push-buffer method
          with a new buffer. Optionally, the queue size in the appsrc can be
          controlled with the enough-data and need-data signals by respectively
          stopping/starting the push-buffer calls. The value of the
          min-percent property defines how empty the internal appsrc queue
          needs to be before the need-data signal will be fired. You can set
          this to some value >0 to avoid completely draining the queue.
        </para>

      It's purpose is to register the elements provided by the plugin with
