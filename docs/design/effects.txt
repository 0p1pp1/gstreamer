  A. The registry
  B. Effects configurability
  C. Keyframes
4. Use-cases

The goal of this proposal is to find a simple way to handle effects through an
API which would allow developers to handle any use-case

1. Basic ideas
----------------

  * Effects are actually descendant of GESTrackOperation
  * You can add effects wherever you want
  * Effects are configurable and those could change during time
  * We should be able to handle the gnome-video-effects standard
  * We can implement complexe effects

2. Problems
----------
  * We should be able to handle list of available effects on the system at
    runtime.

  * We should be able to configure effects through an API in GES and
    not directly configuring the corresponding GstElement properties.

  * We should be able to handle complexe effects.

  * We should be able to implement complexe effects directly in GES

  * We should be able to configure effects in the time -> Keyframes without
    duplicating code from GStreamer


3. Propositions to solve those problems
---------------------------------------

A. The registry

  We could implement a GESEffectRegistry which would actually
  retrieve elements from the GSTRegistry which actually are effects,
  as well as effects from gnome-video-effects. This way the developers
  could have the list of all the effects that are installed on the systÃ¨me
  pretty easily.

B. Effects configurability

  The idea to be able to configure effects through a simple API in GES would
  be to create a class GESEffect which would actually be a mapping between
  a GESTrackOperation and the properties of the GstElements contained in the
  GESTrackOperation.
  Basicly it would allow the retrieving of all configurable elements properties:
    * names
    * human readable names
    * types
    * possible values
    * ...
  We would also have a method to set those properties easily

  The problem which also happens is that in the case of gnome-video-effects,
  we should be able to allow access to some properties whiches have been
  specified. We will need to improve the current standard in order to handle
  this use-case.

C. Keyframes
  We may want to handle this use-case directly in GES and for any kind of
  time related configuration? FIXME
    => Special specifications for that?

4. Use-cases
-----------

  The user wants to add an effect to an entire clip => GESTimelineObject new API

  The user wants to add an effect to an entire layer => GESTimelineLayer API.

  The developer wants to allow his users to configure effects => mapping between 
  GESTrackEffect and the configurable properties of elements (GESEffect).

  The user wants to add an effect on a special portion of a clip, we should 
  allow him to configure that thanks to a system of keyframes. FIXME

  We want to implement an effect which isn't only composed by a bin, but is more
  complexe than that (ex: "effect '24'") => we have the GESTrackOperation
  which is the base class (abstract) for this kind of implementation. We should 
  also have a GESPropertiesMapping abstract class which would be the base 
  class of GESEffect and could be used in this use-case.

  A developer wants to implement effect which handle music and video at the same
  time, Would the solution be to implement a GESTimelineEffect to handle this
  special usecase? FIXME
