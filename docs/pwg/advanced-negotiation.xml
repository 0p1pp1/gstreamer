  <para>
    Caps negotiation is the act of finding a media format (GstCaps) between
    elements that they can handle. This process in &GStreamer; can in most
    cases find an optimal solution for the complete pipeline. In this section
    we explain how this works.

  <sect1 id="section-nego-basics">
    <title>Caps negotiation basics</title>

      In &GStreamer;, negotiation of the media format always follows the
      following simple rules:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A downstream element suggest a format on its sinkpad and places the
          suggestion in the result of the CAPS query performed on the sinkpad.
          See also <xref linkend="section-nego-getcaps"/>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          An upstream element decides on a format. It sends the selected media
          format downstream on its source pad with a CAPS event. Downstream
          elements reconfigure themselves to handle the media type in the CAPS
          event on the sinkpad.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          An upstream element can inform downstream that it would like to
          suggest a new format by sending a RECONFIGURE event upstream. The
          RECONFIGURE event simply instructs an upstream element to restart
          the negotiation phase. Because the element that sent out the
          RECONFIGURE event is now suggesting another format, the format
          in the pipeline might change.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      In addition to the CAPS and RECONFIGURE event and the CAPS query, there
      is an ACCEPT_CAPS query to quickly check if a certain caps can
      be accepted by an element.
    </para>
    <para>
      All negotiation follows these simple rules. Let's take a look at some
      typical uses cases and how negotiation happens.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="section-nego-usecases">
    <title>Caps negotiation use cases</title>
    <para>
      In what follows we will look at some use cases for push-mode scheduling.
      The pull-mode scheduling negotiation phase is discussed in
      <xref linkend="section-nego-pullmode"/> and is actually similar as we
      will see. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Since the sink pads only suggest formats and the source pads need to
      decide, the most complicated work is done in the source pads.
      We can identify 3 caps negotiation use cases for the source pads:
    </para>

        <para>
          Fixed negotiation. An element can output one format only.

        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Transform negotiation. There is a (fixed) transform between the
          input and output format of the element, usually based on some
          element property. The caps that the element will produce depend
          on the upstream caps and the caps that the element can accept
          depend on the downstream caps.
          See <xref linkend="section-nego-transform"/>.

    <sect2 id="section-nego-fixed">
      <title>Fixed negotiation</title>
      <para>
        In this case, the source pad can only produce a fixed format. Usually
        this format is encoded inside the media. No downstream element can
        ask for a different format, the only way that the source pad will
        renegotiate is when the element decides to change the caps itself.
      </para>
      <para>
        Elements that could implement fixed caps (on their source pads) are,
        in general, all elements that are not renegotiable. Examples include:

            A typefinder, since the type found is part of the actual data stream

            caps and then push buffers of the type.

        These types of elements also don't have a relation between the input

      <title>Transform negotiation</title>
      <para>
        In this negotiation technique, there is a fixed transform between
        the element input caps and the output caps. This transformation
        could be parameterized by element properties but not by the
        content of the stream (see <xref linkend="section-nego-fixed"/>
        for that use-case).
      </para>
      <para>
        The caps that the element can accept depend on the (fixed
        transformation) downstream caps. The caps that the element can
        produce depend on the (fixed transformation of) the upstream
        caps.
      </para>
      <para>
        This type of element can usually set caps on its source pad from
        the <function>_event()</function> function on the sink pad when
        it received the CAPS event. This means that the caps transform
        function transforms a fixed caps into another fixed caps.

      <para>
        Like with the transform negotiation in

        perform a transformation on the downstream/upstream caps. Unlike the
        transform
        negotiation, this transform will convert fixed caps to unfixed caps. This
        means that the sink pad input caps can be converted into unfixed (multiple)
        formats. The source pad will have to choose a format from all the
        possibilities. It would usually like to choose a format that requires the
        least amount of effort to produce but it does not have to be. The selection
        of the format should also depend on the caps that can be accepted downstream

    <para>
      Let's take the case of a file source, linked to a demuxer, linked to a
      decoder, linked to a converter with a caps filter and finally an audio
      output. When data flow originally starts, the demuxer will parse the
      file header (e.g. the Ogg headers), and notice that there is, for
      example, a Vorbis stream in this Ogg file. Noticing that, it will
      create an output pad for the Vorbis elementary stream and set a
      Vorbis-caps on it. Lastly, it adds the pad. As of this point, the pad
      is ready to be used to stream data, and so the Ogg demuxer is now done.
      This pad is <emphasis>not</emphasis> re-negotiable, since the type of
      the data stream is embedded within the data.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Vorbis decoder will decode the Vorbis headers and the Vorbis data
      coming in on its sinkpad. Now, some decoders may be able to output in
      multiple output formats, for example both 16-bit integer output and
      floating-point output, whereas other decoders may be able to only decode
      into one specific format, e.g. only floating-point (32-bit) audio. Those
      two cases have consequences for how caps negotiation should be
      implemented in this decoder element. In the one case, it is possible to
      use fixed caps, and you're done. In the other case, however, you should
      implement the possibility for <emphasis>renegotiation</emphasis> in this
      element, which is the possibility for the data format to be changed to
      another format at some point in the future. We will discuss how to do
      this in one of the sections further on in this chapter.
    </para>
    <para>
      The filter can be used by applications to force, for example, a specific
      channel configuration (5.1/surround or 2.0/stereo), on the pipeline, so
      that the user can enjoy sound coming from all its speakers. The audio
      sink, in this example, is a standard ALSA output element (alsasink).
      The converter element supports any-to-any, and the filter will make sure
      that only a specifically wanted channel configuration streams through
      this link (as provided by the user's channel configuration preference).
      By changing this preference while the pipeline is running, some elements
      will have to renegotiate <emphasis>while the pipeline is
      running</emphasis>. This is done through upstream caps renegotiation.
      That, too, will be discussed in detail in a section further below.
    </para>
    <para>
      In order for caps negotiation on non-fixed links to work correctly,
      pads can optionally implement a query function that tells peer elements
      what formats it supports and/or prefers. When upstream renegotiation is
      triggered, this becomes important.
    </para>
    <para>
      Downstream elements are notified of a newly set caps with a
      GST_EVENT_CAPS on the sinkpad. So when the vorbis decoder sets a caps on
      its source pad (to configure the output format), the converter will
      receive a caps event. 
      When an element receives a buffer, it should check if it has received
      all needed format information in a CAPS event previously. If it hasn't,
      it should return an error from the chain function.

    <title>Downstream caps negotiation</title>
    <para>
      Downstream negotiation takes place when a format needs to be set on a
      source pad to configure the output format, but this element allows
      renegotiation because its format is configured on the sinkpad caps,
      or because it supports multiple formats. The requirements for doing
      the actual negotiation differ slightly.

        There may also be cases where the filter actually is able to
        <emphasis>change</emphasis> the format of the stream. In those cases,
        it will negotiate a new format. Obviously, the element should first
        attempt to configure <quote>pass-through</quote>, which means that
        it does not change the stream's format. However, if that fails,
        then it should call <function>gst_pad_get_allowed_caps ()</function>
        on its sourcepad to get a list of supported formats on the outputs,
        and pick the first. The return value of that function is guaranteed

    <para>
      Upstream negotiation's primary use is to renegotiate (part of) an
      already-negotiated pipeline to a new format. Some practical examples
      include to select a different video size because the size of the video
      window changed, and the video output itself is not capable of rescaling,
      or because the audio channel configuration changed.
    </para>
    <para>
      Upstream caps renegotiation is requested by sending a GST_EVENT_RECONFIGURE
      event upstream. The idea is that it will instruct the upstream element
      to reconfigure its caps by doing a new query for the allowed caps and then
      choosing a new caps. The element that sends out the RECONFIGURE event
      would influence the selection of the new caps by returning the new
      prefered caps from its GST_QUERY_CAPS query function. The RECONFIGURE
      event will set the GST_PAD_FLAG_NEED_RECONFIGURE on all pads that it
      travels over.

      this pad supports, and in what order of preference. The return value
      should be all formats that this elements supports, taking into account
      limitations of peer elements further downstream or upstream, sorted by
      order of preference, highest preference first.

      Using all the knowledge you've acquired by reading this chapter, you
      should be able to write an element that does correct caps negotiation.
      If in doubt, look at other elements of the same type in our git
      repository to get an idea of how they do what you want to do.
