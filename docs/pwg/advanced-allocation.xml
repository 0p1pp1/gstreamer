    Memory allocation and management is a very important topic in
    multimedia. High definition video uses many magabytes to store
    one single frame of video. It is important to reuse the memory
    when possible instead of constantly allocating and freeing
    the memory.

    Multimedia systems usually use special purpose chips, such as
    DSPs or GPUs to perform the heavy lifting (especially for video).
    These special purpose chips have usually strict requirements
    for the memory that they can operate on and how the memory
    is accessed.

    This chapter talks about the memory management features that
    &GStreamer; plugins can use. We will first talk about the
    lowlevel <classname>GstMemory</classname> object that manages
    access to a piece of memory. We then continue with
    <classname>GstBuffer</classname> that is used to exchange data
    between plugins (and the application) and that uses
    <classname>GstMemory</classname>. We talk about
    <classname>GstMeta</classname> that can be placed on buffers to
    give extra info about the buffer and its memory.
    For efficiently managing buffers of the same size, we take a
    look at <classname>GstBufferPool</classname>. To conclude this
    chapter we take a look at the GST_QUERY_ALLOCATION query that
    is used to negotiate memory management options between elements.
