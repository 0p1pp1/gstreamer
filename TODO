The never-ending story of new features:
* add more codecs into our codec map
* encoding/decoding support lacks:
   - event handling (particularly discont/flush and EOS)
   - prevent data copying
* demux/mux support lacks:
   - good testing of exotic formats
   - correct caps sets on the pad templates
   - event handling in the loop function (mux)
   - prevent data copying
* some sort of codectype-fallback, so that we still register a codec plus its
    mimetype even if we don't have a defined gst-type for it
* ffvideoscale && other filter elements
* can we wrap URLProtocol as a source/sink?
* propagate options like --disable-ffplay (and server and ffmpeg) to ffmpeg
    source tree build directly in AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS instead of the
    'disabletools.diff' patch
