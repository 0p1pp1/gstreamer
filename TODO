The never-ending story of new features:
* add more codecs into our codec map
* encoding support lacks:
   - event handling (particularly discont/flush and EOS)
   - prevent data copying
* demux/mux support lacks:
   - correct caps sets on the pad templates
   - event handling in the loop function (mux)
   - prevent data copying
   - better timestamp handling (particularly in demuxers)
* other filter elements
* can we wrap URLProtocol as a source/sink?
