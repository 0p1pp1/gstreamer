- Interfaces currently contain things that should only be called by implementors
- GstMiniObject binding is broken, we need our own codegen and handle it like a GObject without toggle refs, signals and properties
- Check vmethods and write them by hand if there are parameters that should be hidden (Gst.Index!)
- Check ownership of callback parameters and vmethods
- Make sure callbacks are only GC'd when they can be (TagMergeFunc, TypeFind, ..)
