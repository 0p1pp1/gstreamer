= Media detail browser =
The package contains a UI for browsing media files and showing details of the
files.

= Browsing =
- in the preview hook of the file browser we run discover and update the details
- if one has grillo installed we could use grillo sources in addition to local files
- there should be a "open url" menu entry in addition

= Details =
- show container, video-tracks, audio-track, subtitle-trackes, metadata and
  parsing messages
- auto-play after updating the details
  have a menu command to turn auto-play off
- offer several commands in addition (see below)

example output from commandline tool:
> gst-discoverer -v /home/ensonic/Musik/xotox-hypnocat.mp3 

Topology:
  audio: audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)1, mpegaudioversion=(int)1, layer=(int)3, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2, parsed=(boolean)true
    Codec:
      audio/mpeg, mpegversion=(int)1, mpegaudioversion=(int)1, layer=(int)3, rate=(int)44100, channels=(int)2, parsed=(boolean)true
    Additional info:
      None
    Channels: 2
    Sample rate: 44100
    Depth: 16
    Bitrate: 128000
    Max bitrate: 0
    Tags:

== compare ==
- dup detail pane and allow to pick a new file
- show differing entries in red
- add a narrow vertical bar between the two details panes and mark blocks with a
  delta red
- diffing one (broken) file against several known working files would be nice
  - it would build ranges for the group of files (e.g. for the video width)
  - it would highlight fields that the are different to any of the working files

== analyse ==
- play the file by using fakesinks and gather statistics:
  - bitrate profiles for each a/mediainfo/v track
  - media specific:
    - audio: volume profile
    - video: contrast profile
  - show disconts as vertical bars

== structural view/hex view ==
- make parsing elements post structural messages (if enabled via property)
  - message would contain:
    - stream offset in bytes
    - block identifier (e.g. fourcc)
    - human readable description (if available)
    - flags (e.g. if the block is used or skipped)
    - indentation depth
  - we would need a way to indicate that e.g. h264parse would be indented below
    the containing container block
- a structured hex view would be nice
  (somehow align the parse tree with the hexdump)

== unsorted ==
- handle chapters
- tag lists
  - if there is a "language-code" in the tags (or subtitles?) use flag icons
    - deluge installs some under: /usr/share/pyshared/deluge/data/mediainfo/pixmaps/flags/
  - handle album art in tag lists
  - geo-tags: map-widget?, link to google-maps?
  - artist: links to {last.fm,wikipedia}
- show level meters for audio

== deep scan mode ==
- update fields when playing
  - listen for duration messages on the bus
- get bit-rate over time
  - specify window size, get min,max,avg bitrate for each window
  - gst-mi can draw them as a graph
- get key-frame statistics
  - number of keyframes
  - min,max,avg keyframe intervall
- raw data statistics
  - audio: level, ...
  - video: histogram, ...

= TODO for discoverer =
- add deep-scan mode (see above)
- get duration per stream
  - this would need individual queries on the demuxer src pads
  - or duration as part of per stream tags
