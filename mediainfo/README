= Media detail browser =
The package contains a UI for browsing media files and showing details of the
files.

= Browsing =
- in the preview hook of the file browser we run discover and update the details
- if one has grillo installed we could use grillo sources in addition to local files
- there should be a "open url" menu entry in addition

= Details =
- show container, video-tracks, audio-track, subtitle-trackes, metadata and
  parsing messages
- auto-play after updating the details
  have a menu command to turn auto-play off
- offer several commands in addition (see below)

== compare ==
- dup detail pane and allow to pick a new file
- show differing entries in red
- add a narrow vertical bar between the two details panes and mark blocks with a
  delta red

== analyse ==
- play the file by using fakesinks and gather statistics:
  - bitrate profiles for each a/mediainfo/v track

== hex view ==
- a structured hex view would be nice
  (somehow align the parse tree with the hexdump)
