# Introduction

This is a collection of design documents, formerly maintained in various
different locations and formats, now grouped together and converted
to commonmark.

## Style

We will follow the commonmark specification.

We *should* try to follow this
[style guide](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/#about),
but are still [evaluating solutions](https://github.com/jgm/cmark/issues/131)
for *stable* automatic formatting.

80 columns line width is thus not yet enforced, but strongly suggested.

# Build a web portal from the sources

## Install dependencies

* Follow [hotdoc's installation guide](https://people.collabora.com/~meh/hotdoc_hotdoc/html/installing.html),
  preferably in a virtualenv.

* We *experimentally* use the hotdoc C extension to include functions by
  name, follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/hotdoc/hotdoc_c_extension)

* Optionally install the `hotdoc_search_extension`:

```
pip install hotdoc-search-extension
```

* Build the portal:

```
hotdoc run
```

* And browse it:

```
xdg-open build/html/index.html
```
