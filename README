DISCLAIMER
----------

This project is no where near completion and should NOT be used AT ALL 
in any release-ready/stable project. By building and installing this
project, you understand that no support will be given and it may very 
well set fire you your system and delete all of your data. If this 
happens, the only person responsible is yourself. You have been warned.

(It probably won't be that bad)


INSTALLATION
------------

To build gstreamer-sharp, you must have a subversion checkout of 
gtk-sharp-2.0:

  $ cd ~/cvs/mono
  $ svn co svn://svn.myrealbox.com/source/trunk/gtk-sharp
  $ cd gtk-sharp
  $ ./bootstrap-2.14 --prefix=/usr
  $ cd parser
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

This will patch, build, and install the fixed gapi-fixup tool without
overwriting your existing gtk-sharp library install. Of course, substitute
~/cvs/mono/ for the proper location of each respective checkout.

Once gapi-fixup has been installed, you may continue building 
gstreamer-sharp like any other source module.
