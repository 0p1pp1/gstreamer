# Qt tutorials

## Welcome to the GStreamer SDK Qt tutorials

These tutorials describe Qt-specific topics. General GStreamer concepts
will not be explained in these tutorials, so the [Basic
tutorials](tutorials-basic.md) should
be reviewed first. The reader should also be familiar with basic Qt
programming techniques.

The Qt tutorials have the same structure as the [Android
tutorials](tutorials-android.md): Each one builds on top of the
previous one and adds progressively more functionality, until a working
media player application is obtained in \#FIXME\#
