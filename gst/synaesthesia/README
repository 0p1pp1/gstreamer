This is a nifty visualization based on synaesthesia-2.0 (see README-syna).
I've librarified the program to a fair degree, but don't have all the
output stuff working yet.  I'll be looking at ALSAPlayer's modifications
to synaesthesia to see what they did to merge it into another
architecture.  It shouldn't be too hard to get this working, I just
haven't had a need yet.
