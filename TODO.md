# Todo

This is just a simple TODO list to follow progress of the port from
gstreamer.com content to hotdoc

Pages to review:
 - [installing]
   - installing/on-windows.md

For-later pages:
 - tutorials/qt-tutorials.md [tpm: this should all be rewritten from scratch with qmlglsink; QtGStreamer is outdated and unmaintained, we should not promote it]
   - basic-media-player.md
   - qt-gstreamer-vs-c-gstreamer.md
   - using-appsink-appsrc-in-qt.md

Miscellaneous:
 - internal refs are used but not defined? (e.g. #getting-gstreamer-source)
 - faq/git.md should be renamed building.md and turned into general
   building Q+A or (better) point to a page we have for all that by then
 - faq/legal.md needs an overhaul, and be made more relevant
