# Todo

This is just a simple TODO list to follow progress of the port from
gstreamer.com content to hotdoc

Pages to review:
 - [installing]
   - sdk-installing-on-windows.md

For-later pages:
 - sdk-qt-tutorials.md [tpm: this should all be rewritten from scratch with qmlglsink; QtGStreamer is outdated and unmaintained, we should not promote it]
   - sdk-basic-media-player.md
   - sdk-qt-gstreamer-vs-c-gstreamer.md
   - sdk-using-appsink-appsrc-in-qt.md
