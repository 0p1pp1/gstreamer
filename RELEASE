Release notes for GStreamer 0.11.0 "It's a boy"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce the first release
in the 0.11.x unstable series of the
core of the GStreamer streaming media framework.


The 0.11.x series is an unstable series targeted at developers.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.10.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.10.x series.


The 0.11.x series has improved memory management and features
various cleanups and enhancements.


This module, gstreamer, only contains core functionality.
For actual media playback, you will need other modules.

gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plug-ins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect
