Release notes for GStreamer Python bindings 1.11.2

The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the second release of the unstable
1.11 release series. The 1.11 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 1.10 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework. The unstable 1.11 release series
will lead to the stable 1.12 release series in the next weeks. Any newly added
API can still change until that point.


Full release notes will be provided at some point during the 1.11 release
cycle, highlighting all the new features, bugfixes, performance optimizations
and other important changes.


Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided in the next days.
