Release notes for GStreamer libav Plugins 1.3.3

The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the third release of the unstable
1.3 release series. The 1.3 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0 and 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework. The unstable 1.3 release series
will lead to the stable 1.4 release series in the next weeks, and newly added
API can still change until that point.


This is hopefully the last 1.3 development release and will be followed by
the first 1.4.0 release candidate (1.3.90) in 1-2 weeks. Which then hopefully
is followed by 1.4.0 soonish in early July.


Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided separately
during the unstable 1.3 release series.


This module contains plugins based on the libav project, including codecs.



Other modules containing plugins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
