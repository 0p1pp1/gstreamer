Release notes for GStreamer Python bindings 1.4.0


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new feature release
in the 1.0.x stable series of the GStreamer Python Bindings.



This new version introduces the possibility to write GStreamer
elements in python and get them registered in the GstRegistry.
This means those elements will then be usable by any application
that uses GStreamer, whatever language their are built with.
