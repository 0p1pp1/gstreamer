GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer FFmpeg 0.8.1 "Just Another Victim"
        

The GStreamer team is happy to announce the first stable release of the
FFmpeg-based GStreamer plugin.


This module is separated from GStreamer Plugins for easier maintenance
and decoupled release cycles.
Our CVS contains both the patched source code to FFmpeg, as well as the
set of patches against upstream CVS, so we can send patches upstream
regularly from our modifications.

      * codecs for most popular formats
      * optimized colorspace conversion

CVS is hosted on cvs.freedesktop.org.
All code is in CVS and can be checked out from there.
Interested developers of the core library, plug-ins, and applications should
subscribe to the gstreamer-devel list. If there is sufficient interest we
will create more lists as necessary.
