Release notes for GStreamer RTSP Server Library 1.3.1


The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release of the unstable
1.3 release series. The 1.3 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0 and 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework. The unstable 1.3 release series
will lead to the stable 1.4 release series in the next weeks, and newly added
API can still change until that point.



Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided separately
during the unstable 1.3 release series.



The versioning scheme that is used in general is that 1.x.y is API and
ABI backwards compatible with previous 1.x.y releases. If x is an even
number it is a stable release series and all releases in this series
will only contain important bugfixes, e.g. the 1.0 series with 1.0.7. If
x is odd it is a development release series that will lead to the next
stable release series 1.x+1 and contains new features and bigger
changes. During the development release series, new API can still
change.
