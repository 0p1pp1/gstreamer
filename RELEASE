Release notes for GStreamer Editing Services 1.7.1


The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release of the unstable
1.7 release series. The 1.7 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework. The unstable 1.7 release series
will lead to the stable 1.8 release series in the next weeks. Any newly added
API can still change until that point.


Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided separately
during the unstable 1.7 release series.
