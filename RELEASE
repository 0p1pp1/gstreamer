GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer FFmpeg Plug-ins 0.10.1 "Late Train"
        

The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the
GStreamer FFmpeg Plug-ins.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.


This module contains plug-ins using libraries from the FFmpeg project.



Other modules containing plug-ins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plug-ins
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect
