Release notes for GStreamer RTSP Server Library 1.3.3

The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the third release of the unstable
1.3 release series. The 1.3 release series is adding new features on top of
the 1.0 and 1.2 series and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release
series of the GStreamer multimedia framework. The unstable 1.3 release series
will lead to the stable 1.4 release series in the next weeks, and newly added
API can still change until that point.


This is hopefully the last 1.3 development release and will be followed by
the first 1.4.0 release candidate (1.3.90) in 1-2 weeks. Which then hopefully
is followed by 1.4.0 soonish in early July.


Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided separately
during the unstable 1.3 release series.
