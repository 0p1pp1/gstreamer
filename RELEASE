GStreamer: Release notes for GStreamer Python bindings 0.9.7 "Mon Chien N'a Pas De Nez"
        

The GStreamer team is petrified to announce a new release
in the 0.9.x development series of the
GStreamer Python Bindings.


The 0.9.x series is a development series and not recommended for end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.

  
Features of this release
    
      * Parallel installability with 0.8.x series
      * Threadsafe design and API
      * Updates for API changes

Bugs fixed in this release
    
      * 322250 : Remove *_full wrappers
