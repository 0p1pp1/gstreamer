Release notes for GStreamer C# bindings 0.9.0 "Good things come to those who wait"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a first development release
of the GStreamer C# bindings for the 0.10.x release series.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.

Please note that at this time the GStreamer C# bindings
        are not consindered API/ABI stable, and public interfaces
	may still change from release to release. These changes
	will most likely be small. Please read the README file
	for more information on this.
