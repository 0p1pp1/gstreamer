Release notes for GStreamer OpenMAX IL wrapper plugin 1.9.2

The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the second release of the unstable
1.9 release series, which marks the feature freeze for 1.10. The 1.9 release
series is adding new features on top of the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 series
and is part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series of the GStreamer
multimedia framework. The unstable 1.9 release series will lead to the stable
1.10 release series in the next weeks. Any newly added API can still change
until that point.


Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided in the next days.


This module contains a plugin that wraps available OpenMAX IL
components and makes them available as standard GStreamer
elements.



Other modules containing plugins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
