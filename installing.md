## Linux

The GStreamer community does not provide binaries for GNU/Linux
platforms as it will always be available through package managers on
all distribution. It is also always installed by default on desktop
environments, you will just need to make sure you have the development
packages installed (refer to your distribution documentation for more
information). If you really want to run upstream style binaries on
Linux, you can always follow the instructions to [build from source
using cerbero](building-from-source-using-cerbero.md).
