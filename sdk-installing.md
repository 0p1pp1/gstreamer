## Linux

The GStreamer community does not provide the SDK for GNU/Linux platforms
as it will always be available through  package managers on all
distribution. It is also always installed by default on desktop
environments, you will just need to make sure you have the development
packages installed (refer to your distribution documentation for more
information). If you really want to run the Sdk on Linux, you can
always follow the instructions to
[build from source using cerbero](sdk-building-from-source-using-cerbero.md).
